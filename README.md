This homework focuses on using Python to automate data analysis for financial records and election results, making it faster and more efficient than using spreadsheets.
I created scripts for each task that read data from CSV files, calculated things like total amounts, averages, and changes, and then saved the results to text files. 
This assignment showed how powerful Python can be for handling large datasets in a way that would be hard to do manually.
